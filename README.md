# Turtle_Racing
A fun betting game using Python's `turtle` library where players guess which turtle will win a race.

## Description
In this project, multiple turtles race towards the finish line, and the player must guess which turtle will win. The game utilizes `turtle` for graphics and animation, and `random` to determine race outcomes.

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The required libraries are:
- `turtle` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `random` (built-in module)

## Installation
No additional installation is required since both libraries are included with Python by default.

## Usage
Run the Python script using the following command:
```sh
python TURTLE_RACE.py
```
Make sure you are running `TURTLE_RACE.py` to start the game.

Players must guess the winning turtle among these colors and enter it before the game starts:
- Red
- Blue
- Green
- Yellow
- Purple
- Orange

## Features
- Players place a bet on a turtle before the race starts
- Multiple turtles race to the finish line
- Uses `turtle` for fun and interactive graphics
- Uses `random` to generate unpredictable race outcomes
- Randomized race outcomes for replayability
